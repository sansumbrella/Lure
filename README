You are a worm. You are struggling not to drown, but your frantic wriggling is attracting the attention of fish. Good luck.

A game for the Fishing Jam: http://jam.legendaryfisher.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=70
Jam allowed for 7 days, but I ended up spending two afternoons and a morning on the game.
