You are a worm. You are struggling not to drown, but your frantic wriggling is attracting the attention of fish. Good luck.

A game for the Fishing Jam: http://jam.legendaryfisher.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=70
Jam allowed for up to 7 days, I spent about X amount of time

TODO:
[x] Start a project
[x] Draw something to screen
[x] Draw water
[x] Draw mountain
[x] Draw worm
[x] Worm sinking
[x] Basic user interaction
[x] Worm health (shown by color and strength of motion)
[x] Draw a fish
[x] Simple verlet physics engine for worm body
[x] - Node
[x] - Spring
[x] Segment-based user interaction
[x] Fixes needed to work in processing.js (String and noise adjustments)
[x] Launch worm through air at start (click to focus/start, type to play)
[x] Restore friction/underwater boundaries on impact with surface
[x] Background stars
[x] Fish physics construction
[x] Linear fish motion
[x] Fish wandering
[x] Basic fish attraction
[x] Web wrapper for application
[x] Big text overlay
[] Fish casual to serious interest
[] Easier to move (more force, more friction, more gravity)
[] Get eaten by fish

[] Death info on big text overlay (drowned)
[] Death info (ett)
[] Keep score: time X size of fish (display in html)

[] Physics spring for text overlay (node in center of screen tied to text node)
